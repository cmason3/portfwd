## CHANGELOG

#### 1.0.2 - 31st January 2024
- When a connection is closed the total number of bytes sent and received is now printed

#### 1.0.1 - 30th January 2024
- Added support for `-conf` so you can specify TCP and/or UDP forwarders within a configuration file
- Command line arguments can now be shortened so you can now pass `-t` instead of `-tcp` 
- Updated error logging so you can easily redirect `stdout` to a logfile so we can run as a daemon

- Initial release
